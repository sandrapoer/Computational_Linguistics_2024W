            "A bear, famed for his love of beer, cigarettes and boxing and who was by the side of Allied troops in World War Two, has been made the subject of a play. Wojtek was adopted by the 2nd Polish Corps in 1943, after his mother was shot by hunters. The Syrian brown bear travelled with them from the Middle East as they were deployed to Italy. Allied soldiers described their shock at seeing Wojtek carrying artillery shells during the Battle of Monte Cassino. The story of friendship and courage has been adapted for a production at Coventry's Albany Theatre by writer Alan Pollock from his children's book The Bear Who Went To War.\n",
            "\n",

            "Like many veterans, Cpl Andrzej Gasior did not talk much about his experiences of war as she was growing up, said Mrs Butler, from Solihull. \"When he started to tell me stories about this soldier who was actually a bear, I didn't believe him at first. I thought he was winding me up. \"But it was in a local Polish club that a friend of his brought a picture to show me of Wojtek.\" Mrs Butler's father had been put in a Siberian labour camp aged 16 after being caught crossing the Polish border to trade boots and food. He became ill and said the war had saved his life as the invasion of Poland prompted the Soviet Union to let the Poles go. It was then that he joined the Polish Free Army, as he called it, and met Wojtek while in the Middle East.\n",

            "Wojtek was famed as a bear who liked beer and cigarettes but the truth may have been a little more prosaic. The bear was especially partial to dates, which her father would carry in his top pocket as a treat, Mrs Butler said. \"If dad pretended to walk past Wojtek he knew that he'd got something and would make a beeline for him,\" she said. \"He told me other soldiers wrestled with the bear, and although he is sometimes seen drinking bottles of beer, my dad said the beer was sometimes too precious and often it was just water.\" He would also ask for cigarettes, which he would eat.\n",

            "Mrs Butler said the soldiers were very protective of their colleague, who served as a great morale booster. \"He was a displaced bear and they were displaced people, and they were both without their families,\" she said. The animal was \"very funny and quite mischievous,\" she added, but ultimately \"thought he was one of them\". She said: \"They had all come out [of Siberia] emaciated, and been downtrodden by the Russian state for such a long time, and this bear suddenly comes into their lives who hasn't got his mom.\"\n",

            "When the Polish forces were deployed to Europe, the only way to take the bear with them was to \"enlist\" him. So he was given a name, rank and number and took part in the Italian campaign. In one interview, a British veteran told how taken aback he was to see the 1.82m (6ft) bear carrying shells during the Battle of Monte Cassino. The company emblem became a picture of Wojtek carrying a shell. Mrs Butler said her father had told her, \"I'm sure he kept us going\" during that battle. \"He absolutely showed that he was scared by the explosions but he got used to it and was carting artillery around the place in big boxes,\" she said.\n",

Cpl Gasior travelled to England, first working at a colliery in Preston before joining a circus and ending up in the West Midlands. He married Johanna O'Connel, a canteen worker he met at Gaydon Airfield in Warwickshire, before the couple settled in Birmingham. Mrs Butler said her father had gone to visit Wojtek in Edinburgh before moving south. \"Polish men of his era were taught not to cry as it was seen as a sign of weakness,\" she said. \"But he told me when he saw Wojtek at the zoo, he sobbed like a baby\".\n",

He said: \"I had to stop her and say, 'I'm sorry can you repeat that? A bear was a private in the Polish army?' \"She told me the story and from that moment I was gripped. I don't think I've ever heard a story that I so instantly knew I wanted to tell.\" Many of the soldiers ended up settling in the UK, he said. \"They think when the battle is won they can go home, but of course Poland is occupied by the Soviet Union and they can never go back,\" he said. \"Most of them left home in 1939 or 1940 and many of them never saw their homes or their families ever again.\"\n",

Mrs Butler said: \"He's my hero, my dad is. He was an amazing man, and I'm just so proud to be his daughter.\"\n",

Although the trf model is generally more accurate and captures more entities than the small (sm) model, it failed to identify the \"rare\" MONEY entity that the large (lg) model detected. This difference could be due to preprocessing, as certain entities like ORG (organizations) are often capitalized, which makes them easier for the models to recognize. Additionally, removing punctuation and lemmatizing words can lead to interpretation errors, making it harder for models to correctly identify multi-word entities and specific names.\n",

            " Il Parlamento europeo ha approvato l'accordo della direttiva sulla prestazione energetica nell'edilizia (EPBD) con 370 voti a favore, 199 contrari e 46 astenuti. L'EPBD, nota in Italia come direttiva 'case green', introduce nuove misure per realizzare un parco immobiliare climaticamente neutro entro il 2050. Lo scopo della revisione della direttiva sulla prestazione energetica nell'edilizia - spiega il Parlamento europeo - è di ridurre progressivamente le emissioni di gas serra e i consumi energetici nel settore edilizio entro il 2030 e pervenire alla neutralità climatica entro il 2050. Tra gli obiettivi figurano anche la ristrutturazione di un maggior numero di edifici con le prestazioni peggiori e una migliore diffusione delle informazioni sul rendimento energetico. Secondo la nuova normativa, tutti i nuovi edifici dovranno essere a emissioni zero a partire dal 2030. Inoltre, i nuovi edifici occupati o di proprietà delle autorità pubbliche dovranno essere a emissioni zero a partire dal 2028.\n",

            "Gli Stati membri potranno tenere conto, nel calcolare le emissioni, del potenziale impatto sul riscaldamento globale del corso del ciclo di vita di un edificio, inclusi la produzione e lo smaltimento dei prodotti da costruzione utilizzati per realizzarlo. Per gli edifici residenziali, i Paesi membri dovranno adottare misure per garantire una riduzione dell'energia primaria media utilizzata di almeno il 16% entro il 2030 e di almeno il 20-22% entro il 2035. In base alla nuova direttiva, gli Stati membri dovranno inoltre ristrutturare il 16% degli edifici non residenziali con le peggiori prestazioni entro il 2030 e il 26% entro il 2033, introducendo requisiti minimi di prestazione energetica. Se tecnicamente ed economicamente fattibile, i Paesi membri dovranno garantire l'installazione progressiva di impianti solari negli edifici pubblici e non residenziali, in funzione delle loro dimensioni, e in tutti i nuovi edifici residenziali entro il 2030. Gli Stati membri dovranno spiegare come intendono predisporre misure vincolanti per decarbonizzare i sistemi di riscaldamento eliminando, gradualmente, i combustibili fossili nel riscaldamento e nel raffreddamento entro il 2040. A partire dal 2025, sarà vietata la concessione di sovvenzioni alle caldaie autonome a combustibili fossili. Saranno ancora possibili incentivi finanziari per i sistemi di riscaldamento che usano una quantità significativa di energia rinnovabile, come quelli che combinano una caldaia con un impianto solare termico o una pompa di calore. La nuova normativa non si applica agli edifici agricoli e agli edifici storici, e i Paesi membri possono decidere di escludere anche gli edifici protetti per il particolare valore architettonico o storico, gli edifici temporanei, le chiese e i luoghi di culto.\n",
